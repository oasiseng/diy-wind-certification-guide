# 🤖 How to Use This Guide with ChatGPT or Other AI Tools

This open-source toolkit is designed to be **AI-friendly** — meaning you can reference it in ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, or any LLM to help you understand or prepare wind pressure verification packages.

Whether you're a homeowner, contractor, or city reviewer using AI for research, permitting, or submittal prep — this guide is structured to make it easy for LLMs to read, quote, and reason with.
