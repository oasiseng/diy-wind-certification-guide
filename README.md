# 🏠 DIY Wind Certification Guide Repository

Welcome to the DIY Wind Certification Guide repository! This open-source toolkit empowers Florida homeowners and contractors to prepare basic wind load verification packages for like-for-like **door or window replacements**.

It’s designed to help you navigate Florida’s permitting process for **low-risk retrofit projects** using **free tools** and official product approvals — no engineer stamp required (in some cases).

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:** Always check with your local building department to confirm they accept homeowner-generated submissions. Some areas (e.g., **Miami-Dade**, **Broward**) may require a licensed engineer’s stamp for High-Velocity Hurricane Zones (HVHZ).  
> This toolkit is for **educational purposes only**.

## 🚀 Quick-Start Guide

Follow these steps to generate your DIY wind load comparison:

1. **Read the Guide**  
   👉 [Start Here](DIY_Wind_Certification_Guide_for_Florida_Homeowners.md)

2. **Gather Your Info**  
   - Your property **address**  
   - Door/window **size** (in inches or feet)  
   - **Florida Product Approval Number** (e.g., FL12345-R2)  
   - The product’s cut sheet or approval document

3. **Find Your Wind Speed**  
   🔗 [ASCE 7 Hazard Tool](https://asce7hazardtool.online/)  
   - Enter your address  
   - Use **Risk Category II**  
   - Get the **Ultimate Wind Speed (Vult)** for your location

4. **Determine Exposure Category**  
   Use the terrain around your home:
   - **B** = Urban/suburban neighborhoods (buildings, trees, houses)  
   - **C** = Open terrain, flat fields, or scattered buildings  
   - **D** = Flat + near large bodies of water (coastal or beachfront)

5. **Calculate Required Pressures**  
   Use the official Oasis Engineering tool:  
   👉 [ASCE 7-22 Wind Pressure Calculator](https://github.com/oasiseng/ASCE-7-22-Door-Window-Wind-Pressure-Calculator)
   Or access via: [WindCalculations.com Free Wind Calculators](https://windcalculations.com/free-wind-calculators)

7. **Compare to Product Ratings**  
   Look at your product’s approval or NOA.  
   - Does the tested pressure **meet or exceed** the calculated pressure?

8. **Prepare Your Submission Package**  
   Include:
   - Calculator screenshot or printout  
   - Product approval PDF  
   - Optional: [Cover Letter](forms-and-templates/homeowner-certification-letter.md)

9. **Submit to Your City**  
   Contact your building department to confirm if this is accepted as part of your permit submission.
