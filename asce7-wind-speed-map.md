## 🔍 What You’re Looking For

Look for the **Ultimate Wind Speed (Vult)** in **mph**.

Example:  
> "Ultimate Design Wind Speed (Vult) = **170 mph**"

This is the value you’ll enter into the [Oasis Wind Pressure Calculator](https://github.com/oasiseng/ASCE-7-22-Door-Window-Wind-Pressure-Calculator)

## 📘 Florida Building Code Overrides for HVHZ

> 🛑 **IMPORTANT FOR MIAMI-DADE & BROWARD USERS**

The **ASCE 7 Hazard Tool** shows the nationally adopted wind speed maps (often 168–170 mph in South Florida), but the **Florida Building Code (FBC 2023), Section 1620.2** requires **higher minimum wind speeds** for structural design in High-Velocity Hurricane Zones (HVHZ):

### Minimum Wind Speeds (Vult) per FBC 1620.2

#### **Miami-Dade County**
- Risk Category I: **165 mph**
- Risk Category II: **175 mph**
- Risk Category III: **186 mph**
- Risk Category IV: **195 mph**

#### **Broward County**
- Risk Category I: **156 mph**
- Risk Category II: **170 mph**
- Risk Category III: **180 mph**
- Risk Category IV: **185 mph**

> ✅ **Use these higher wind speeds** when calculating required pressures, even if ASCE 7 maps show a lower number.

Additionally, all structures in HVHZ are considered to be in **Exposure Category C**, unless you clearly qualify for Exposure D. (FBC 1620.3)
