# 🏠 DIY Wind Certification Guide for Florida Homeowners

This guide will help you — as a Florida homeowner — **prepare your own wind load verification package** for like-for-like **door or window replacements**, using official tools and publicly available data.

> ⚠️ This guide is intended for **low-risk retrofit projects only**, such as replacing an exterior door or window with a product of similar size and function.  
> It does **not** apply to new openings, structural changes, or unpermitted modifications. Always check with your local building department first.

## 🧰 What You’ll Need

Before you begin, gather:

- 📍 Your **project address**
- 🪟 Your product’s **Florida Product Approval number** (e.g., FL12345-R3)
- 📄 A copy of the product’s **cut sheet** or **approval PDF**
- 📏 Door/window **dimensions** (in inches or feet)

---

## 🚶 Step-by-Step Instructions

### ✅ Step 1: Find Your Wind Speed

Use the **ASCE 7 Hazard Tool** to get the official wind speed for your address.

🔗 [Visit ASCE 7 Hazard Tool](https://asce7hazardtool.online)

1. Enter your full project address  
2. Use **Risk Category II**  
3. Write down the **Ultimate Wind Speed (Vult)** in mph

---

### ✅ Step 2: Determine Your Exposure Category

Exposure categories describe how open your property is to wind.

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **B** | Urban or suburban, with lots of buildings and trees |
| **C** | Open terrain with few obstructions (fields, rural land) |
| **D** | Coastal, flat land, or near open water (e.g., beach homes) |

> Most Florida neighborhoods fall into Category **C** unless you’re heavily sheltered or oceanfront.

### ✅ Step 3: Calculate Wind Pressures

Use the free Oasis Engineering wind pressure calculator:

🔗 [ASCE 7-22 Wind Pressure Calculator](https://github.com/oasiseng/ASCE-7-22-Door-Window-Wind-Pressure-Calculator)
🔗Or access via: [WindCalculations.com Free Wind Calculators](https://windcalculations.com/free-wind-calculators)

1. Enter your wind speed from Step 1  
2. Enter your door/window dimensions  
3. Choose your exposure category  
4. Use default Topographic Factor (Kzt = 1.0) unless your property is on a steep hill  
5. Enter the area of the door/window (length × width in ft²)

📸 Save or screenshot your result. You’ll need this for your documentation package.

---

### ✅ Step 4: Get Your Product's Rated Pressures

1. Go to the [Florida Product Approval Database](https://www.floridabuilding.org/pri/Pages/FloridaProductApprovalSearch.aspx)
2. Enter your product’s **Approval Number**
3. Download or view the PDF approval sheet
4. Locate the **tested pressures** (e.g., +65 / –70 psf)

---

### ✅ Step 5: Compare Values

- Does your **product's rated pressures** meet or exceed the **calculated pressures** from the tool?
- If yes, your product meets basic wind requirements for your location.

> Example:  
> - Required pressure = –60 psf  
> - Product rated to –70 psf ✅ Good to go!

If not, contact your supplier or consider an alternative product.

---

### ✅ Step 6: Prepare Your Submission Package

Your building department may accept a basic DIY package with:

- ✅ A short cover letter  
- ✅ Screenshot or PDF from the pressure calculator  
- ✅ Florida Product Approval PDF

📄 Use this template for your cover letter:  
[homeowner-certification-letter.md](forms-and-templates/homeowner-certification-letter.md)

---

### ✅ Step 7: Submit to Your City or County

Before submitting, always:

- 📞 Call your local building department  
- ✅ Ask if a DIY wind load comparison is acceptable for your scope  
- 📤 Submit your documentation with your permit application

If your municipality **requires engineering letters**, Oasis Engineering offers stamped packages for a fee:

## 🙋 Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I use this for new openings or remodels?**  
No. This guide is for **replacing existing doors/windows only** with like-for-like products.

**Q: What if I live in Miami-Dade or Broward?**  
You’ll likely need a **sealed engineering letter** due to HVHZ requirements.

**Q: What if my door size is not standard?**  
Use your actual dimensions to calculate the correct area. The pressure depends on square footage.

## ⚠️ Final Reminders

- ✅ Always check local permitting requirements first  
- ✅ Double-check all values before submitting  
- 🧠 When in doubt, consult a licensed professional
