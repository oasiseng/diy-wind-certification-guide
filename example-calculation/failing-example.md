# ❌ Failed Wind Comparison Example

This shows what happens when a product doesn’t meet the required pressures.

---

## Scenario:
- Required: –85.4 psf (Zone 5)
- Product Rating: –70 psf ❌ FAIL

> Even though the product passes in Zone 4, it **fails in Zone 5** (typically corners or edges). You must select a product rated for the **worst-case zone**.

---

✅ Solution:
- Choose a higher-rated product
- Or submit sealed calcs from a licensed engineer
