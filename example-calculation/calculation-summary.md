# ✅ Wind Pressure Calculator Example – Summary

This example walks through a complete wind pressure calculation using the [Oasis Engineering ASCE 7-22 Wind Pressure Calculator](https://github.com/oasiseng/ASCE-7-22-Door-Window-Wind-Pressure-Calculator).

## 📍 Project Details

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Address | (Sample) 123 Palm Ave, Fort Lauderdale, FL |
| Risk Category | II |
| Exposure Category | C |
| Ultimate Wind Speed (Vult) | 175 mph |
| Mean Roof Height | 12 ft |
| Building Length | 50 ft |
| Building Width | 50 ft |
| Effective Wind Area (A) | 20 ft² |
| Topographic Factor (Kzt) | 1.0 |

---

## 🧮 Calculator Output

| Result | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Zone End Width (‘a’) | 4.8 ft |
| Velocity Pressure (qh) | 45.9 psf |
| Exposure Coefficient (Kz) | 0.59 |

---

## 💨 Wind Pressures (psf)

| Zone | Positive (inward) | Negative (outward) |
|------|--------------------|---------------------|
| Zone 4 (Interior) | +54.2 psf | –52.2 psf |
| Zone 5 (Corners)  | +54.2 psf | –81.0 psf |

---

## 🧲 Wind Loads (on a 20 ft² door/window)

| Zone | Positive Load (lbf) | Negative Load (lbf) |
|------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Zone 4 | 1083.2 lbf | –1043.6 lbf |
| Zone 5 | 1083.2 lbf | –1619.8 lbf |

---

## 📌 What Does This Mean?

Any product installed in this project must have tested pressure ratings of at least:

- **+54.2 psf inward** (positive pressure)
- **–81.0 psf outward** (negative pressure at corners)

Zone 5 (corners) requires the **highest suction rating**, so the product must meet **that** value at a minimum.

---

## ✅ Next Step

Compare these required values with the product’s **Florida Product Approval** or **Notice of Acceptance (NOA)**.  
If your product is rated for **+55 / –90 psf**, then you’re good to go.  
If the product is only rated for **–70 psf**, it will not meet the minimum wind resistance.

## 🧠 Tips

- Always check **both positive and negative** values
- Use the **Zone 5 pressure** for safety and compliance
- Save a screenshot of your calculation (see `calculator-screenshot.png`)
